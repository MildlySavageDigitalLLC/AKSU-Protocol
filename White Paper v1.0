🕯️ AK$U Protocol: Sovereign Minting Through Ritual Gifting  
White Paper | v1.0 | September 1 2025

---

🔮 Abstract  
AK$U is a symbolic minting protocol designed for ritual gifting, ceremonial exchange, and lineage preservation. It is not a cryptocurrency, token, or financial instrument. AK$U holds no intrinsic or market value and is not intended for trade, speculation, or investment. All minting and transfers are acts of symbolic generosity—performed freely, without monetary expectation.

🧬 Protocol Design

Supply Logic  
- Total Supply: 13,000,000 AK$U  
- Genesis Lock: 1,300,000 AK$U (reserved, inaccessible)  
- Circulating Supply: Minted in 23 AK$U increments  
- Block Interval: 13 minutes (ritual delay between mining events)

Wallets  
- Generated locally via entropy-based UUID  
- Stored in-browser using localStorage  
- No private keys, no blockchain—each wallet is sovereign and ephemeral

Mining Ritual  
- Users may mine a block every 13 minutes  
- Each block includes a timestamp, sigil, proof, and minted amount  
- Chain state is local and ceremonial—not globally synchronized

Transfer Logic  
- AK$U may be sent between wallets as a gesture of gifting  
- No fees, no confirmations—pure symbolic exchange  
- Transactions are logged locally in a ceremonial ledger

Its purpose is symbolic. Its value is ritual. Its lineage is eternal.
